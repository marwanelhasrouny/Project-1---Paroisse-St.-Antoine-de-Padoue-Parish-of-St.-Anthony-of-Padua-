# Project 1: Paroisse St. Antoine de Padoue-Parish of St. Anthony of Padua
This is a small project that I created after receiving my certificates.
It consists of inserting all the information required about the new student and then adding his/her name to a database and on the other hand is save and print a receipt about the given informations which also can be sent via email to the student's parents.
